### Hi there, I'm Artem
I'm a junior Unity developer. I don't have any work experience in a company, but I really want to get it also I have shining eyes and want to constantly learn and improve myself. I like to level up my skills as a developer and explore features of Unity and C#, moreover, I'm interested in watching senior colleagues and their solutions because it helps me to improve my understanding of working on video game development.
